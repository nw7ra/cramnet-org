# Welcome to CRAMnet

A high speed, redundant, freely available, and non-commercial network supporting emergency, non-profit, and hobbyist communication needs in the lower Columbia River valley.

* 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz carrier grade wireless hardware that is affordable and readily available provides high-speed point-to-multi-point access at 15mbps to 150mbps+ rate.
* The network is redundantly designed with multiple RF pathways and tunnels between primary nodes. When primary communication channels are down or overloaded, the mesh network can carry voice, video, and data throughout the region.
* Commercial use is disallowed by Part 97 rules, allowing the network to remain for public use.
* Amateur radio operators are encouraged to join the mesh network at will; no central coordination or approval is needed.

Development began on the CRAMnet in mid-June 2022.

As of July 3rd, 2022, there are **4** nodes operating on the 5.8 GHz band in Rainier, OR and West Longview, WA using [AREDN](http://arednmesh.org) firmware.

Additional nodes are on hand and will be deployed as site arrangements are secured.

## Partners

* [**Cascade Amateur Radio Society (CARS)**](https://cascadeamateurradio.net/) has provided an initial batch of hardware purchased by grant.
